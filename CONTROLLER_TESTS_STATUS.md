## ⚠️ Known Issue: HTTP Routing Not Working in Tests

### Problem Description

All controller tests are returning **404 status** for HTTP requests, despite:
- ✅ Routes ARE registered (286 routes confirmed via `Route::getRoutes()`)
- ✅ Application environment is correctly set to "testing"
- ✅ Route names exist and are accessible (customers.index, login, etc.)
- ✅ Service tests (non-HTTP) work perfectly
- ❌ **ALL HTTP requests via `$this->get()`, `$this->post()`, etc. return 404**

### Evidence

```php
// Routes ARE loaded
Route::has('customers.index') // returns TRUE
count(Route::getRoutes()) // returns 286

// But HTTP requests fail
$this->get('/customers') // returns 404
$this->get('/login') // returns 404
$this->get('/') // returns 404
$this->get('/sanctum/csrf-cookie') // returns 404
```

### Investigation Summary

**Checked:**
- ✅ RouteServiceProvider is registered in config/app.php
- ✅ routes/web.php file exists and contains routes
- ✅ CreatesApplication trait properly bootstraps app
- ✅ TestCase extends Laravel's base TestCase
- ✅ Middleware configuration
- ✅ Exception Handler
- ✅ APP_URL configuration
- ✅ Cache cleared multiple times

**Not an Issue With:**
- Route registration (routes are loaded)
- Application bootstrapping (app() works, environment is "testing")
- Permissions/Authentication (even unauthenticated routes like /login fail)
- Database (service/unit tests pass)

### Possible Causes

1. **APP_URL Mismatch**: The .env file has `APP_URL=http://localhost/test/admin-panel/public` which includes a subdirectory. Laravel's test HTTP client may not be accounting for this path prefix.

2. **Request Dispatcher Issue**: Something in the HTTP request lifecycle is preventing proper route matching in test environment.

3. **Middleware Early Exit**: A global middleware might be catching all requests and returning 404 before reaching route matching.

4. **Service Provider Order**: Routes might not be fully loaded when HTTP tests execute.

## 🔧 Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Investigation Steps (Recommended for Team)

Since other tests in this project may have solved this issue, check:

```bash
# Search for any passing HTTP/controller tests
php vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/ --stop-on-failure

# Check if there are working examples
grep -r "->get\|->post" tests/Feature/
```

### Option 2: Use Direct Controller Testing

Instead of HTTP testing, call controllers directly:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\CustomerController;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

test('index displays customers list', function () {
    Customer::factory()->count(5)->create();

    $controller = app(CustomerController::class);
    $request = Request::create('/customers', 'GET');
    $response = $controller->index($request);

    expect($response->status())->toBe(200);
});
```

### Option 3: Fix APP_URL Configuration

Create `.env.testing` file:

```env
APP_ENV=testing
APP_URL=http://localhost
# ... other test environment settings
```

Or modify phpunit.xml to override APP_URL properly.

### Option 4: Debug Request Lifecycle

Add temporary debugging to `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

```php
protected $middleware = [
    function ($request, $next) {
        \Log::info('Test Request', [
            'uri' => $request->getRequestUri(),
            'method' => $request->method(),
        ]);
        return $next($request);
    },
    // ... rest of middleware
];
```

## 📋 Test Execution Commands

### Run Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Customer tests
php vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Controllers/CustomerControllerTest.php

# Customer Insurance tests
php vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Controllers/CustomerInsuranceControllerTest.php

# Quotation tests
php vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Controllers/QuotationControllerTest.php

# Claim tests
php vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Controllers/ClaimControllerTest.php

# Notification Template tests
php vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Controllers/NotificationTemplateControllerTest.php
```

### Run All Controller Tests

```bash
php vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Controllers/
```

### Run with Specific Filter

```bash
php vendor/bin/pest --filter="index displays" tests/Feature/Controllers/
```

## 📊 Test Structure

All tests follow this consistent pattern:

```php
beforeEach(function () {
    // Seed roles and permissions
    $this->seed(RoleSeeder::class);
    $this->seed(UnifiedPermissionsSeeder::class);

    // Create authenticated user with all permissions
    $this->user = User::factory()->create();
    $this->user->givePermissionTo(\Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission::all());

    $this->actingAs($this->user);
    session()->put('user_id', $this->user->id);

    // Bypass permission middleware
    $this->withoutMiddleware([
        \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\PermissionMiddleware::class,
        \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\RoleMiddleware::class,
        \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\RoleOrPermissionMiddleware::class,
    ]);
});
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Consult with team members who have run tests successfully in this project
2. **Short-term**: Implement one of the recommended solutions above
3. **Long-term**: Once HTTP routing is fixed, run full test suite to identify any other issues
