## Testing Patterns Used

### 1. Mocking Dependencies
```php
beforeEach(function () {
    $this->repository = Mockery::mock(CustomerRepositoryInterface::class);
    $this->fileUploadService = Mockery::mock(FileUploadService::class);
    $this->service = new CustomerService($this->repository, $this->fileUploadService);
});
```

### 2. Event Faking
```php
Event::fake([CustomerRegistered::class, CustomerProfileUpdated::class]);
// ... perform action
Event::assertDispatched(CustomerRegistered::class);
```

### 3. Transaction Testing
```php
test('create policy uses transaction', function () {
    $this->repository->shouldReceive('create')
        ->once()
        ->andThrow(new Exception('Database error'));

    expect(fn () => $this->service->createPolicy($data))
        ->toThrow(Exception::class, 'Database error');
});
```

### 4. Factory Usage
```php
$customer = Customer::factory()->create(['email' => 'test@example.com']);
$policy = CustomerInsurance::factory()->create(['customer_id' => $customer->id]);
```

### 5. Edge Case Handling
```php
test('handles null email when finding', function () {
    $result = $this->service->findByEmail('');
    expect($result)->toBeNull();
});
```

## Key Testing Insights

### 1. Transaction Management
All critical operations use transactions:
- Customer creation/update/delete
- Policy creation/update/delete
- Quotation creation/update/delete

Tests verify rollback occurs on failures.

### 2. Event Dispatching
Services properly dispatch events:
- `CustomerRegistered` - After customer creation
- `CustomerProfileUpdated` - After profile changes
- `QuotationGenerated` - After quotation creation

### 3. Error Handling
Comprehensive error scenarios:
- Duplicate email detection
- Invalid status values
- Non-existent records
- Database constraint violations
- Transaction rollbacks

### 4. Business Logic Validation
- IDV calculation accuracy
- Premium calculations
- Commission breakdown
- Family policy access control
- Renewal date filtering

### 5. Edge Cases
- Null/empty values
- Zero amounts
- Missing optional fields
- Large datasets
- Concurrent operations
