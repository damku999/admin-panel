## 🔔 REMINDERS & ALERTS

### **Before Each Task**
- ✅ Read current implementation notes
- ✅ Check for any blockers or dependencies
- ✅ Ensure understanding of success criteria
- ✅ Plan rollback strategy if needed

### **After Each Task**
- ✅ Update this todo status
- ✅ Add implementation notes
- ✅ Update master session context
- ✅ Commit changes with descriptive message

### **Critical Safety Reminders**
- 🛡️ **No refactoring without tests**: Implement tests for new patterns first
- 💾 **Small commits**: Commit each logical change separately
- 🔄 **One pattern at a time**: Don't mix multiple refactoring types
- 📊 **Measure impact**: Track before/after metrics
