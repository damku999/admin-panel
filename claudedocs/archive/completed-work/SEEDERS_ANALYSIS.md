1. **PolicyTypesSeeder and PremiumTypesSeeder were SWAPPED** - Fixed
2. **Missing AddonCover ID 10 (Other)** - Added
3. **All master data seeders contained fake placeholder data** - Replaced with production data
4. **Inconsistent ID assignments** - Standardized across all seeders

---

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. SWAPPED SEEDERS (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** PolicyTypesSeeder and PremiumTypesSeeder had their data swapped.

**Before:**
- PolicyTypesSeeder: Contained FRESH, ROLLOVER, RENEWAL (3 records) - WRONG!
- PremiumTypesSeeder: Contained 34 insurance policy types - WRONG!

**After:**
- PolicyTypesSeeder: Now contains 34 insurance policy types (correct)
- PremiumTypesSeeder: Now contains FRESH, ROLLOVER, RENEWAL (correct)

**Impact:** This swap could have caused major data integrity issues in policy management.

---

### 2. Missing AddonCover Record

**Issue:** AddonCoversSeeder was missing ID 10.

**Fixed:** Added missing record:
```
ID 10: Other
```

**Impact:** References to addon_cover_id = 10 would have failed.

---

### 3. Fake Placeholder Data Replaced

**Issue:** Multiple seeders contained fake/placeholder data instead of production data.

**Seeders Updated:**
- BranchesSeeder: Had 10 fake branches → Now has 1 real branch (AHMEDABAD)
- BrokersSeeder: Had 6 fake brokers → Now has 5 real brokers
- RelationshipManagersSeeder: Had 8 fake managers → Now has 10 real managers
- ReferenceUsersSeeder: Had 14 fake sources → Now has 2 real reference users

## Data Integrity Impact

### High Impact Changes

1. **PolicyTypes/PremiumTypes Swap Fix**
   - **Risk Level:** CRITICAL
   - **Impact:** Prevents data corruption in policy management
   - **Action Required:** Run fresh migration or update existing data

2. **AddonCover ID 10 Addition**
   - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
   - **Impact:** Enables proper addon cover categorization
   - **Action Required:** Verify no existing references to ID 10

### Medium Impact Changes

3. **Master Data Replacements**
   - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
   - **Impact:** Ensures production data consistency
   - **Action Required:** Verify relationships with existing customer/policy data

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Re-run seeders in fresh environment** to verify all changes
2. **Update AppSettingsSeeder** to reference correct policy_type IDs
3. **Audit existing customer_insurances table** for policy_type_id references
4. **Check quotations table** for premium_type_id usage

### Data Migration Strategy

If database already has production data:

```bash
# Step 1: Backup current database
php artisan db:backup

# Step 2: Truncate and reseed lookup tables
php artisan db:seed --class=PolicyTypesSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=PremiumTypesSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=AddonCoversSeeder

# Step 3: Update master data
php artisan db:seed --class=BranchesSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=BrokersSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=RelationshipManagersSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=ReferenceUsersSeeder

# Step 4: Verify data integrity
php artisan tinker
>>> DB::table('policy_types')->count(); // Should be 34
>>> DB::table('premium_types')->count(); // Should be 3
>>> DB::table('addon_covers')->count(); // Should be 10
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run complete database refresh with seeders
- [ ] Verify policy types in customer insurance forms
- [ ] Verify premium types in quotation forms
- [ ] Check addon covers dropdown shows all 10 options
- [ ] Validate branch/broker/RM dropdowns show real data
- [ ] Test reference user selection in customer forms
