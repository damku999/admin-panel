    {
        parent::setUp();
        
        $this->repository = Mockery::mock(RepositoryInterface::class);
        $this->dependency = Mockery::mock(DependencyInterface::class);
        
        $this->service = new ServiceClass(
            $this->repository,
            $this->dependency
        );
    }

    // Test methods following consistent patterns

        $this->createTestEnvironment();
    }

    public function test_complete_workflow_success(): void
    {
        // Given: Initial state setup
        // When: Execute workflow steps
        // Then: Verify expected outcomes
