# Migration Cleanup Analysis

## üîç Analysis Results: Migration vs Project Usage

I've analyzed your project to identify which migrations are actually used vs which ones can be cleaned up.

### ‚úÖ **USED TABLES/MIGRATIONS** (Keep These)

#### Core Insurance System Tables - ‚úÖ USED
- `users` - User management system (has controller, model, routes)
- `customers` - Customer management (has controller, model, routes, views)
- `customer_insurances` - Policy management (has controller, model, routes, views)
- `brokers` - Broker management (has controller, model, routes, views)

- `model_has_permissions` - Permission assignment (Spatie)
- `model_has_roles` - Role assignment (Spatie)
- `role_has_permissions` - Role-permission mapping (Spatie)

#### Family System Tables - ‚úÖ USED
- `family_groups` - Family group management (has controller, model, routes, views)
- `family_members` - Family member management (has model, used in family views)

#### Claims System Tables - ‚úÖ USED
- `claims` - Claim management (has controller, model, routes, views - **21 routes!**)
- `claim_stages` - Claim stage tracking (has model, used in claim views)
- `claim_documents` - Claim document management (has model, used in claim views)
- `claim_liability_details` - Liability details (has model, used in claim views)

#### Audit & Activity Tables - ‚úÖ USED
- `activity_log` - Spatie Activity Log (used throughout for audit trails)
- `customer_audit_logs` - Customer-specific audit (has model, used in customer portal)

#### Reports System Tables - ‚úÖ USED
- `reports` - Report management (has controller, model, routes)

#### Laravel System Tables - ‚úÖ USED
- `failed_jobs` - Laravel queue system
- `password_resets` - Laravel password reset
- `personal_access_tokens` - Laravel Sanctum (API authentication)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMMUNICATION SYSTEM** (Partially Implemented)

#### Notification Module - üìä PARTIALLY USED
**Evidence of Usage:**
- Has API controller: `App\Modules\Notification\Http\Controllers\Api\NotificationApiController`
- Has service interface: `App\Modules\Notification\Contracts\NotificationServiceInterface`
- Has service implementation: `App\Modules\Notification\Services\NotificationService`
- Has **14 API routes** for notification functionality
- Used in events and listeners for communication

**Required Tables:**
- `message_queue` - Message queue system ‚úÖ **KEEP**
- `delivery_status` - Delivery tracking ‚úÖ **KEEP**
- `notification_templates` - Template management ‚úÖ **KEEP**
- `communication_preferences` - User preferences ‚úÖ **KEEP**

### ‚ùå **UNUSED/QUESTIONABLE TABLES** (Can be Removed)

#### Event Store Table - ‚ùì QUESTIONABLE
- `event_store` - Event sourcing table
- **Evidence:** Has listener `app/Listeners/EventSourcing/StoreEventInEventStore.php` but no controllers/routes
- **Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remove if not using event sourcing** (likely development artifact)

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN**

### Option 1: Keep Everything (Safest)
Keep all migrations as they have some level of implementation, even if minimal.

### Option 2: Remove Event Store Only (Recommended)
Remove only the `event_store` table and related migration if you're not using event sourcing.

### Option 3: Keep All for Future Use
The notification system and event store might be planned features - keep for future development.

## üìã **MISSING MODELS TO CREATE** (For Complete Implementation)

You have migrations but missing some models:

```bash
# Models that should exist but might be missing:
- MessageQueue (for message_queue table)
- DeliveryStatus (for delivery_status table)
- NotificationTemplate (for notification_templates table)
- CommunicationPreference (for communication_preferences table)
- EventStore (for event_store table) - if keeping
```

## üöÄ **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

**KEEP ALL MIGRATIONS** - Your project is well-structured and all tables appear to have some level of usage:

1. **Core insurance system** - Fully implemented ‚úÖ
2. **Claims management** - Fully implemented ‚úÖ
3. **Family system** - Fully implemented ‚úÖ
4. **Notification system** - API implemented, models might be missing ‚ö†Ô∏è
5. **Event store** - Partially implemented, questionable usage ‚ùì

The SQL sync file should include **ALL current migrations** as they're all part of your active system.

## ‚ö° **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Run the complete SQL sync** (all tables are needed)
2. **Create missing models** for notification system if needed
3. **Test all functionality** after sync
4. **Remove event store later** if confirmed unused

Your migration cleanup is **minimal** - the project is well-organized with legitimate business requirements for all tables.
