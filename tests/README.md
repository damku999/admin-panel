## Core Components Coverage

### Models (100% Coverage Target)
- **User**: Admin user model with roles/permissions
- **Customer**: Customer model with family relationships
- **FamilyGroup**: Family management system
- **Quotation**: Insurance quotation system
- **QuotationCompany**: Company quote comparisons
- **CustomerInsurance**: Active policy management
- **Claim**: Claims management system
- **InsuranceCompany**: Insurance provider data

### Controllers (100% Coverage Target)
- **Admin Controllers**: Full CRUD operations
- **CustomerAuthController**: Complex authentication flows
- **API Controllers**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Customer Portal Controllers**: Customer-facing features

### Services (100% Coverage Target)
- **QuotationService**: Complex quotation generation
- **PdfGenerationService**: PDF document creation
- **FileUploadService**: Secure file handling
- **SecurityService**: Security operations

### Middleware (100% Coverage Target)
- **SecurityRateLimiter**: Advanced rate limiting
- **CustomerAuth**: Customer authentication
- **VerifyFamilyAccess**: Family data access control
- **SecureSession**: Session security

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Models**: Test all relationships, scopes, and business logic methods
- **Services**: Test all business logic with mocked dependencies
- **Middleware**: Test security and validation logic

### 2. Feature Tests
- **Controllers**: Test all HTTP endpoints with proper authentication
- **Authentication**: Test login, registration, password reset flows
- **Authorization**: Test role-based access control

### 3. Integration Tests
- **Workflows**: Test complete business processes end-to-end
- **Data Flow**: Test data consistency across related models
- **Security**: Test security measures across the application

### 4. Security Tests
- **SQL Injection**: Test prevention measures
- **XSS Protection**: Test input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Test token validation
- **File Upload Security**: Test upload restrictions
- **Rate Limiting**: Test abuse prevention

## Key Test Scenarios

### Authentication & Authorization
- Admin login/logout flows
- Customer registration and email verification
- Family group access controls
- Password reset security
- Session management and timeouts

### Business Logic
- Quotation generation with multiple companies
- Premium calculations and comparisons
- PDF generation for quotes and policies
- Family insurance management
- Claims processing workflows

### Security
- Rate limiting enforcement
- SQL injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- File upload validation
- Family data isolation

### Data Integrity
- Model relationships and constraints
- Audit logging functionality
- Soft delete operations
- Data validation rules

## Test Database Configuration

Tests use a separate test database with:
- In-memory SQLite for speed (optional)
- Database transactions for isolation
- Factory-generated test data
- Seeded roles and permissions

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Targets
- **Models**: 100% line coverage
- **Controllers**: 95% line coverage
- **Services**: 100% line coverage
- **Middleware**: 100% line coverage

### Excluded from Coverage
- Migration files
- Configuration files
- Third-party package files
- Generated IDE helper files

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test suites
php artisan test --testsuite=Unit
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage

# Run specific test file
php artisan test tests/Unit/Models/CustomerTest.php

# Run with verbose output
php artisan test --verbose
```

## Test Data Management

### Factories
- Comprehensive factories for all models
- Relationship factories for complex data structures
- State-based factories for different scenarios

### Seeders (Test Environment Only)
- Basic roles and permissions
- Sample insurance companies
- Test customer data with families

### Database Cleanup
- Automatic database refresh between tests
- Transaction rollback for isolation
- Temporary file cleanup

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with:
- Automated test execution
- Coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test runs independently
2. **Data Factories**: Use factories instead of fixtures
3. **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies
4. **Assertions**: Clear and specific assertions
5. **Documentation**: Well-documented test methods
6. **Performance**: Fast test execution
7. **Security**: Comprehensive security testing

## Test Maintenance

- Regular review of test coverage reports
- Update tests when business logic changes
- Maintain factories with model changes
- Monitor test performance and optimize slow tests
