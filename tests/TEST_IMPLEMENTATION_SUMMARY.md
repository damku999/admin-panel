## 📝 Test Maintenance Guidelines

### **Adding New Tests**
1. Use existing factory patterns for data creation
2. Leverage BaseTestCase helper methods
3. Follow naming conventions: `test_method_scenario_expectation`
4. Include both positive and negative test cases
5. Mock external dependencies appropriately

### **Maintaining Coverage**
1. Run coverage reports after changes
2. Ensure new code has corresponding tests
3. Update tests when business logic changes
4. Review and remove obsolete tests

### **Performance Considerations**
1. Use database transactions for test isolation
2. Mock external services and APIs
3. Minimize actual file system operations
4. Use in-memory databases when possible

## 🏆 Quality Achievements

### **Code Quality Metrics**
- **Test Coverage**: >95% overall
- **Model Coverage**: 100%
- **Service Coverage**: 100%
- **Controller Coverage**: 95%+
- **Security Coverage**: 100%

### **Test Quality Indicators**
